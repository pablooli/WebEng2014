# Hello Task! Server (standalone)
This project contains a demonstration of a web service build with [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html) 
that can run standalone. That is, it does not require to be deployed in a server.

Run the code with ```gradle server``` and then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/task](http://localhost:8080/task) to 
retrieve a HTML page generated by JAX-WS that describes the service. 

Given that ```TaskWebService``` is a class annotated as ```@WebService``` with ```@WebMethod```s, the code required to run it 
in standalone mode is:
```java
public class Server {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Endpoint.publish("http://localhost:8080/task", new TaskWebService());
	}
}
```
